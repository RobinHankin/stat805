# Overview {-}

This is the handbook for STAT805 (mathematics).  Details of the course
structure, including assessment and timetables, may be found on
AUTonline.  The whole course is based around R and RStudio which may
be downloaded from

[https://cran.r-project.org/]

and

[https://www.rstudio.com/]

respectively.

The statistics component of STAT805 has been recorded and the entire
playlist is available on YouTube at:

```{block2, type='youtube'}
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL018X5Hlr4RkgE65Pg93TFY-32KCVpW84>
```

which you may view at your leisure (the mathematics component should
be added ast some point in the future).  The URL should be clickable
in this and similar boxes throughought the manual.  Note that the
course as delivered will vary slightly from the YouTube videos and in
particular the material might be presented in a different order; but
each class is a reasonably self-contained unit, split into three or
four parts.  The videos are also available in a slightly different
format on Mediasite.  To view, log in to AUTonline and then

`content system -> institution -> learn -> maths`

takes you to a number of mathematical resources, including the videos
which are at `STAT601` or `STAT805`.
